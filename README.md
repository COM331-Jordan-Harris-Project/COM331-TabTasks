## COM 331 Solo Project One, Professor Karl Stolley
### Problem
I tend to get lost in a sea of tasks, or simply forget something that I had meant to do. This often results in aimlessly browsing Facebook and endlessly opening new tabs.

### Solution
Replace my new tab page with something resembling [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages). An aesthetically pleasing task tracker that I **have** to look at every time I open a new blank tab might be a good start!

## TODO:
* Implement task affirmation functions
  * Currently just a check and x button without a function
* Tasks should be smarter, based on system clock with a deadline that matters beyond bookkeeping
* Better reminder text
  * Urgency/deadline?
  * Grammar/syntax?
  * Capitalization .to_case?
* Standardize/enforce timeframes and deadlines
* Reorganize SCSS, fix hacks, implement rems
* Collapsible sidebar
  * Move some functions into sidebar, a screenshot of my attempt is in the notes directory

## Known bugs:

* The delete function broke, I don't know which commit it broke at. Reverting to the haml/html that was generated for it does not work, I assume I messed up the controller somewhere.
