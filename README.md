## [COM 331 Solo Project One](https://courses.karlstolley.com/app/projects/#project-one), Professor Karl Stolley
### Problem
I tend to get lost in a sea of tasks, or simply forget something that I had meant to do. This often results in aimlessly browsing Facebook and endlessly opening new tabs.


### Solution
Replace my new tab page with something resembling [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages). An aesthetically pleasing task tracker that I **have** to look at every time I open a new blank tab might be a good start!

#### How's it look?

## TODO:
* Implement task affirmation functions
  * Currently just a check and x button without a function
* Tasks should be smarter, based on system clock with a deadline that matters beyond bookkeeping
* Better reminder text
  * Urgency/deadline?
  * Grammar/syntax? Currently handled with seeds.rb
  * Capitalization, some form of .to_case?
* Standardize/enforce timeframes and deadlines
* Reorganize SCSS, fix hacks, implement rems
  * [Curious about this for potential deduplication? Probably best to do it by hand though.](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/)
* Collapsible sidebar


## Known bugs:

* Known bugs have been squashed!


## Wishlist
* Wallpaper slider
  * [Here are some example wallpapers (unattributed)](https://imgur.com/a/Xz9Ea)
* Improved layout
* Google/configurable search
* Expanded featureset
  * Options
  * Weather?
* Optional slide-out sidebar
  * Moving some functions into sidebar might be nice, a screenshot of my rudimentary attempt from much earlier in the project is in [the \_notes directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmynes/COM331-TabTasks/master/_notes/sidebarAttempt.png)
  * [Useful sidebar w/ non-intrusive JS search terms](https://www.google.com/search?q=off+canvas+navigation)
